# CLI — every app function from a terminal

The desktop app and the CLI call the same services (`src/main`, Electron-free).
Nothing the app can do is missing from the CLI: `tests/unit/cli-map.test.ts` fails
when an app function (IPC channel) has no command, when a command is undocumented
here, or when this file is out of date.

## Three ways to run it

| Where | How | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| In the app | **CLI** in the sidebar | Same commands, run inside the running app (shares its wallet, service link and state). A recovery phrase or secret key is never shown or typed here; spending still needs `--yes`. |
| PowerShell from the app | CLI screen → **Open in PowerShell** | Opens a shell with `devnet-dvpn` ready, using the app's data folder. |
| Any terminal | `node out/cli/devnet-dvpn.cjs <command>` (dev) · `devnet-dvpn <command>` (installed) | Build with `npm run build:cli`. |

Flags on every command: `--json` (machine output, one JSON line) · `--yes` (do it; without
it a spend or system change only prints what it would do) · `--keyfile <path>` (use a key file
in place, never copied).

Exit codes: `0` ok · `1` error · `2` needs `--yes` · `3` usage.

Environment: `DVPN_DATA_DIR`, `DVPN_KEYFILE`, `DVPN_DAEMON_PIPE`, `DVPN_DAEMON_HOME`,
`DVPN_NO_BRIDGE=1`. Test rigs only: `DVPN_DAEMON_TARGET`, `DVPN_NODE_API_OVERRIDES`,
`DVPN_PROVIDER_API_OVERRIDES` (see `scripts/e2e/rig-env.sh`, `box-rig.sh env`).

Output never contains RPC API keys (URL query strings are redacted) or secrets.

## Tests
- `tests/unit/cli-map.test.ts`: every app function → a CLI command; every command documented here.
- `scripts/e2e/cli-e2e.sh [local|daemon|all] [--spend]`: runs the commands against devnet
  (spend tier needs a rig: `scripts/e2e/wsl-rig.sh` or `scripts/e2e/box-rig.sh`).
