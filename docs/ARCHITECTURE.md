- **Only the daemon is privileged.** The app is unelevated after install. The single elevated
  operations are install, first-run `init`, and applying daemon settings (D4), each through one
  UAC prompt that copies a pre-validated file — never a shell string with config inside it
  (M5.3 #8).
- **Two keys.** Owner key (the user's wallet) signs grants, subscriptions, settlement and
  withdrawals. Device key (inside dvpnd) signs channels, vouchers and node API calls, within the
  allowance the owner granted.
- **No server of ours.** The app talks to the daemon, Solana RPC, nodes and providers. Optional
  third-party calls (IP check, speed test) are listed in Settings and can be turned off.

## Source layout (planned)

Two-layer split (TypeScript mandate): pure logic in `core/` (no Electron, unit-tested with real
devnet fixtures); Electron/OS glue in `main/`. Every file ≤ 500 lines, one example per module.

```
src/
  shared/            types, IPC enum + tier map, error codes, string catalogue keys
  core/
    chain/           idl (devnet IDL + deployed sizes/offsets), accounts, pdas, builders, tx, errors
    daemon/          proto + client wrapper, status mapping, close reasons
    nodes/           discovery, metadata verify, tls pin, country map

    scheduler.ts     polling + streams (F5)
    wallet/          safeStorage vault, signer (in-app), relay server (browser mode)
    system/          settings store, elevated apply, system proxy, startup, tray, notifications
    node-test/       NodeTestService + adapter (F20)
    logger.ts
  preload/           contextBridge api
  renderer/          screens (Welcome, Connect, Nodes, Plans, Sessions, Settlements, Wallet,
                     Settings, Diagnostics, Node test), components, theme tokens
```

Port sources for each module: [`REUSE-MAP.md`](REUSE-MAP.md).

## IPC tiers (M5.2 #1)

Every channel is tagged with its blast radius; tests prove the map matches the registered handlers.

| tier | examples |
|---|---|
| ui | theme, language, window |
| readonly | nodes, plans, balances, sessions, rpc health, doctor |
| local | settings (app store), favourites, history export, system proxy |
| privileged | daemon settings apply, service restart, restore network |
| spend | connect (opens channel), subscribe, settle, withdraw, top up, mandate, send |

`spend` handlers always show the cost or effect first and require an explicit confirm from the
renderer; they serialise per owner key so two writes never race a blockhash (PM `tx.js`
`broadcastQueue`).

## Data at rest

| data | where |
|---|---|
| owner secret | `%APPDATA%/Devnet dVPN/wallet.secret` (safeStorage) |
| app settings, favourites, history, settlement queue, node cache | `%APPDATA%/Devnet dVPN/*.json` |
| node-test runs | `%APPDATA%/Devnet dVPN/node-tests/` |
| logs | `%APPDATA%/Devnet dVPN/logs/` (rotating, redacted) |
| daemon config, device key, daemon db | `C:\ProgramData\dvpnd\client\` (daemon-owned) |

Every persisted model round-trips through JSON (bigints as strings) — tested (F13.6).
